My main objective in this project was to create an intelligent agent that could effectively navigate the labyrinth and find the treasure in order to solve the problem of pirate mazes. The code that was sent to me included building the pirate intelligent agent using a Python Deep Q Network (DQN) technique. In order to choose the best path through the labyrinth, the DQN algorithm, a reinforcement learning approach, strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation. The design defense emphasizes the value of exploration and exploitation in problem-solving by going into depth about the approach, how the intelligent agent functions, and an examination of the chosen algorithm.

My responsibilities as a computer scientist on this project included comprehending the ideas behind exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning. For the project, it was necessary to make the connection between the course material and the larger field of computer science. To effectively handle difficult jobs, computer scientists create intelligent agents, such as the one created for the pirate maze issue. Finding a balance between exploration and exploitation is essential to issue resolution because it reflects how people approach difficulties. This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning concepts may be applied to develop an agent that can learn and modify its approach to effectively navigate the maze.


Within the broader field of computer science, experts utilize methodsical approaches to issues, utilizing models and algorithms to identify the best possible answers. A computer scientist's ethical duties include making sure that the algorithms they build are trustworthy and equitable since they have a direct effect on end users and organizations. Since the agent's behaviors in the labyrinth are determined by its rewards and punishments, ethical questions come into play in this situation. The creation of algorithms that enhance the overall influence of computer science on society by avoiding biases, adhering to ethical norms, and offering a great user experience are all examples of ethical duties.
